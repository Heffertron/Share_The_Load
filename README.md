# Share the Load

Share the Load is the complete refactor of the iOS app [LotR Quiz](http://apps.apple.com/app/id1446587245). It is a side project being worked on by [Chris Hefferman](https://twitter.com/heffertron) with code review, mentorship and Swift guru [Ben Sullivan](https://twitter.com/MrMcSwiftFace). 

The project is also featured on the podcast [Fireside Swift](https://firesideswift.com) to support Chris' journey to becoming an iOS developer, but also to allow the community to follow the project in real time, episode by episode where we will aim to talk about specific topics that come up during the development process. 

I have also created a blog, which will also document some of the decision process that Ben and I make that can't always be covered on the podcast. You can find the link to the blog [here](https://chrishefferman.squarespace.com/blog-landing-page).
